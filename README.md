## Patched xmonad-contrib 

This repo is synced from latest git.  I've included a patch that was not in upstream.  

* fullscreen patch - Apps like mpv and sxiv are unable to use 'f' key to go full screen. A patch was provided https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/888 but was not implemented in xmonad-contrib.
